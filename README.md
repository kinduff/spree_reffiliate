## Installation

To use the stable branch, add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_reffiliate'
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the bleeding edge version, use this line:

```ruby
gem 'spree_reffiliate', github: 'kinduff/spree_reffiliate'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_reffiliate:install
```

### Existing Users
If you already have users within your database, you'll need to run the following command to generate the referral registry for your users:

```shell
bundle exec rake reffiliate:generate
```

## Usage

Referral path is `/r/:code` and Affiliate path (assigned in the admin) is `/a/:path`

Once installed, you'll be able to access the following methods.

#### Spree::User
+ referred_by => user record
+ referral_count => user count
+ referred? => boolean
+ affiliate? => boolean
+ affiliate => affiliate record
+ referral => referral record

#### Spree::Referral
+ code => referral code
+ referred_users => array of users
+ referred_orders => array of orders
+ referred_count => user count
+ referral_activated_users => users with completed orders

#### Promotion Rules

**Important**: in both referrals and affiliates, do **not** fill in the promotion code for the promotion itself to be applied automatically to the user's order. If you add a promotion code, the user will need to apply the for promotion manually.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_reffiliate/factories'
```

## ToDo
+ Add missing documentation
+ Add 2-2-stable and 2-1-stable support (or at least test them)
+ Improve affiliates admin
+ Improve User and Orders listing at user admin
+ Add option or helper to show referral code to the user
